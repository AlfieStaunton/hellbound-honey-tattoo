    <details>
        <summary>How much will it cost?</summary>
        <p>The price differs from piece to piece and from artist to artist. It is influenced by the tattoo's size, complexity, design details, color, and placement on the body. Larger, more intricate, or full-color pieces require more time and materials, leading to a higher cost.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>How much does it hurt?</summary>
        <p>Pain tolerance is highly individual. The pain is often described as a stinging or scratching sensation that can vary depending on the body part being tattooed.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Should I use numbing cream?</summary>
        <p>No, you should not use numbing creams unless specifically instructed by a medical professional, as they can interfere with the tattooing process.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>When can I go swimming or tan?</summary>
        <p>Avoid swimming, hot tubs, and sun tanning until the tattoo is fully healed. Wait several weeks until the skin is completely healed.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Can I bring in a design or get one custom drawn for me?</summary>
        <p>We encourage people to do their research. Have as much material as you can find to let your artist know what you are imagining. We DO NOT copy other people's tattoos. If you find something you love, we can redesign it to make it unique or give ideas for a new design just right for you.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Can I get a tattoo if Im under 18 years old?</summary>
        <p>In Ireland, there is no specific law prohibiting tattooing minors, so it is possible with parental consent, as most studios require. <strong>However, we will not tattoo those under 18 years old.</strong></p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Are the inks you use vegan-friendly?</summary>
        <p>Yes! None of the products we use are involved in animal testing, and they contain no animal ingredients.</p>

            <ul class="aftercare-list">
            <li>💀 Follow Your Artists Instructions: Always follow the specific aftercare instructions <strong> by your tattoo artist.</strong></li>
            
            <li>💀 Leave the Second Skin On: Keep the second skin on for <strong>1-5 days</strong> (depending on the tattoos style and size) after getting your tattoo. If water gets under the second skin (e.g. during a shower or while washing your hands), if the second skin starts to peel off, which means outside air is getting in, or if you notice any signs of irritation, remove the second skin as soon as possible.</li>

            <li>💀 Clean Gently: Wash your tattoo gently with mild, fragrance-free soap and lukewarm water. Pat it dry with a clean paper towel.</li>

            <li>💀 Moisturize: Apply a thin layer of tattoo-specific moisturizer or a fragrance-free lotion to keep the skin hydrated.</li>

            <li>💀 Avoid Sun and Water: Keep your tattoo out of direct sunlight (always and forever) and avoid swimming or soaking in water until its fully healed.</li>
